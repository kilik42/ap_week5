# **Scenario: "The Great Fruit Festival"**

# You're helping to organize a Fruit Festival at your local community center. The festival involves a variety of games, activities, and challenges involving fruits and other general knowledge. Participants will have to make use of lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and booleans to solve challenges and win prizes.

# ---

# **List Challenge:**
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
list2 = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"]
# 1. The participants are shown two lists: `list1` which contains numbers and `list2` which contains the English alphabet. They must:
#     * Display numbers from 3 to 8 from `list1`.
#     * Print the last item in `list1`.
#     * Display letters "c" to "g" from `list2`.

# 2. The next challenge involves a mysterious `fruits` list:
#     * Participants should guess the last fruit in the list.
#     * They must add "pineapple" to the end of the list.
#     * "kiwi" should be inserted at the beginning of the list.
#     * The first, last, and items at certain indices are removed as per instructions. They must keep track of these changes.

# ---



# **Dictionaries Challenge:**

# 1. Participants are shown a dictionary of fruits and their colors. They must:
#     * Display the dictionary.
#     * Guess the color of a certain fruit.
    
# 2. A brief biography of a person named Karen is shown. Participants should:
#     * Correctly update the occupation and country of Karen without altering the original dictionary.
#     * Retrieve and display certain nested values from complex dictionaries as per the given challenges.

# ---

# **Tuples Challenge:**

# 1. A tuple containing numbers is shown. Participants must:
#     * Count how many times the number 2 appears.
#     * Convert the tuple into a list.
#     * Distribute tuple values into separate variables.

# ---

# **Sets Challenge:**

# 1. Two sets of items are displayed. Participants must:
#     * Combine them into one set.
#     * Remove a random item from a given set of names.
#     * Add a new name to the set.

# ---

# **Booleans Challenge:**

# 1. Participants should:
#     * Create a comparison that returns either True or False.
#     * Compare certain mathematical operations and display the result.
#     * Check the validity of a given mathematical statement and display the result.

# ---

# At the end of the challenges, participants proceed to the last slide, where they're congratulated and awarded points based on their performance. Those with the highest points win fruit-themed prizes!

# That's how you can turn the given tasks into an engaging scenario. You could also theme it differently, like an escape room, a school test, or a virtual game. The possibilities are endless!
